# Calories Burning Workout Using Genetic Algorithm
 We created a workout plan that includes 15 activities different including skipping, jogging, jumping jacks, squat, plank, push up, pull up, walking lunges, swimming, cycling, weightlifting, aerobic, abdominal crushes, stretching, and yoga. Thus, N will be from 1<N<15, where N is the number of activities. The data for this project's example will be generated at random using our GA program. To make sure the activity generated by the GA program is balanced, we choose we will use a different amount of time to burn the 1000 calories, which range from 60 seconds to 60 minutes.
